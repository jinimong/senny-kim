    Following the explosive international fame of PSY’s “Gangnam Style” in 2012,
    {'\n'}
    K-pop has become a global trend – it has been receiving spotlight by the
    press including TIME magazine and recognized as “South Korea’s Greatest
    Exports.”
    {'\n'}
    {'\n'}
    Consequently, K-pop has been one of the rapidly growing music genres in the
    world.
    {'\n'}
    {'\n'}
    As K-pop has been being globally promoted through the social media, more and
    more people around the world are getting fascinated. In fact, this genre has
    a massive and wide range of fans around the world, and the K-pop fan bases
    in Canada are gradually growing.

    In Canada, we are mainly targeting two of the most influential ethnic
    groups: Chinese and Korean.

    By aiming at these two major markets, we will perform our best to provide
    with the great foreign cultural experiences and to choose the most
    appropriate marketing platforms for our clients.
